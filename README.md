DATABASE EXERCISE:

The Ministry of Health intends to develop an integrated information system to prescription management and respective contributions with the collaboration of pharmacies and public and private health institutions (hospitals, clinics, health centers, etc.).

In an initial phase, the main functionality of the information system consists of possibility for physicians to enter patient prescriptions into the system and, subsequently, the possibility for the patient to purchase at the pharmacy of their choice, or where the medicine is available, the medicines prescribed. The patient may phase the acquisition of medicines, that is, you will be able to carry out partial withdrawals in different pharmacies.

The physician is solely responsible for inserting the prescription into the system and, for this purpose, must identify himself through an identification and a password previously given to him assigned. The prescription will be entered by a doctor and will refer to a single patient previously entered into the system. The expiry date of the prescription must be defined by the doctor taking into account the clinical situation of the patient and the medications prescribed. To fill the prescription, the doctor can only enter a maximum of 10 medicines (indicating their name, quantity and dosage). in recipes only drugs known to the system can be inserted.

When the patient goes to a pharmacy to buy the medication, the pharmacist (entity conditioned by the system) accesses the prescription(s) through the identification of the customer, the date of the prescription or through the identification of the doctor. The recipe is displayed, with an indication, for each product not yet delivered, if the whether or not it is available for sale at the respective pharmacy. The patient gives an indication of which prescription drugs, available at the pharmacy, you wish to buy, moment from which the respective recipe item is classified as delivered. The system should ensure that the patient can pick up the medications to any pharmacy, but who cannot pick up the same medicine from two or more pharmacies. If a prescription has not been completely delivered by the deadline of validity, shall be considered expired.

Since this system aims to help the patient, it will be possible to consult in public multimedia kiosks all information about medicines, pharmacies where they may be available, the days of service of the pharmacies (days when pharmacies have extended opening hours), as well as data on to recipes.

About each doctor it is necessary to know his name, contact telephone number, what is his main specialty and the various institutions where he works or has worked. The system stores some information about the patients, such as the name, address, citizen card number, date of birth and your identification (number) in the Health System. About pharmacies it is necessary to store your name, address and telephone number (information that can be consulted at the kiosk).

Medicines can be of two types: reimbursed or not. About the medicines it is also necessary to know the code (unique in all the system), the designation, manufacturing laboratory and presentation (syrup, tablets, etc.).

It is also necessary to know, if any, which drugs are substituted for each one of the drugs, since there are several drugs from laboratories different products with similar compositions (the same Active Ingredient).
